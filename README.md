# Coursework-2-Data-Visualization
# Dietary Emissions Visualization ‚Äì Treemap Analysis

This project explores greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from diet across demographic groups, using treemap visualizations and supplementary plots.

## Contents

- `Results_21Mar2022.csv`: Original dataset containing dietary and demographic data.
- `processed_ghg_data.csv`: Cleaned dataset with calculated total and mean GHG emissions.
- `treemap_final_export.png`: High-resolution treemap image showing GHG emissions by sex, age group, and diet type.
- `treemap_final_interactive.html`: Interactive treemap file for dynamic exploration of group-level emissions.
- `boxplot_meat100_sex_agegroup.png`: Boxplot comparing per-capita GHG emissions across age groups and sex (Meat100 only).
- `mean_std_ghgs_meat100_by_sex.png`: Bar chart showing group means ¬± standard deviation for per-capita emissions.
- `sorted_by_mean_ghgs.csv`: Summary table sorted by per-capita GHG emissions.
- `sorted_by_total_ghgs.csv`: Summary table sorted by total GHG emissions.

## Method Overview

1. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Selected relevant columns  
   - Cleaned missing values  
   - Calculated per-capita (`mean_ghgs`) and total (`total_ghgs`) emissions  

2. **Treemap Visualization**  
   - Hierarchy: sex ‚Üí age_group ‚Üí diet_group  
   - Area encodes total GHG emissions (kg CO‚ÇÇe/day)  
   - Color encodes mean GHG emissions per person  

3. **Further Analysis of Unique Observation**  
   - Investigated unusually high emissions in older male Meat100 group  
   - Verified consistency using boxplots and mean ¬± SD analysis
